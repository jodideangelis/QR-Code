## Overview
- This is my first project with Front-End Mentor!  I'd appreciate feedback on how to make my code more efficient, as well as any other advice as a someone still learning these HTML & CSS skills.  I have left comments in my code for areas with specific questions. 
- I am also having a difficult time learning my way around GitHub and the process of pushing, updating, and editing projects. I'd be grateful for any assistance with learning this. 

Thank you! - Jodi

## My process
Google everything and try it out...


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I was having difficulty with centering the entire content in the middle of the screen, as flex and grid would keep it centered horizontally, but not vertically.  I finally figured out to add the 100vh to encompass the whole screen, then centering worked!  Everything else was trial & error, and learning along the way. 


### Useful resources
- Kevin Powell's YouTube videos on CSS really helped me with all components of this project!
